# Multiple Linear Regression and Validation
## Project: Predicting Cost of Hospitalization in Singapore, 2011-2015

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.X **

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer and not the Python 2.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `workTable.ipynb` notebook file. The .csv dataset files are stored in the Datasets directory. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for manipulation. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `MultipleLinearRegression/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook workTable.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook workTable.ipynb
```  

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset was created/contributed by Hxlmxsk for non-commercial but academic use. They may not represent the truth.
